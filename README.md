# The Sipharmony Device Manager - A simple auto-provisioning microservice

The Sipharmony Device Manager is a fast and lightweight device and provisioning server for VoIP IP phones. It is designed to be used with the Wazo-Platform.

The device manager and provisioning server will borrow the concept of "Provisioning keys" from the Wazo-Platform. This will allow you to provision devices with a simple URL and a device key. The device manager will then take care of the rest ðŸ¥³

This provisioning server will not have a frontend, but will be accessible via REST API. This will allow you to build your own frontend or use Postman to interact with the server. It's recommended to incorporate this server into your own frontend or backend.

## Features

- Provision devices with any subdomain and/or FQDN + `/provisioning/{deviceKey}` endpoint
